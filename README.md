# Python-Contactbook-GUI-Tkinter-SQLite
Source code of backend and frontend for a very simple contactbook database app built with Python, Tkinter and SQLite. 
This small project was a good way to make me familiar with the construction of a Graphical User Interface and how to connect a SQLite database and submit and manipulate it's data.
